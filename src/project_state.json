  "summary": "Build a web/PWA version of “STOP Venezolano!” using React + TypeScript frontend with Motoko backend (Internet Computer) and Internet Identity auth, including full game flow, online play via matchmaking and invite codes, Spanish-only UI text, social invite/share buttons (WhatsApp/Telegram/Facebook via native share links), moderation/admin tooling, Stripe-based web monetization, correct per-round scoring when STOP is pressed, and post-match + monthly ranking experiences (including a Top 1 monthly rewards concept).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Adapted scope: implement as web/PWA using React + TypeScript (frontend) and Motoko on Internet Computer (backend).",
    "Authentication via Internet Identity (Firebase Auth not used).",
    "Realtime features implemented using polling (no WebSockets).",
    "Monetization via Stripe web payments (no AdMob or native IAP).",
    "Social invites will use Web Share API and/or share URLs (no official WhatsApp/Telegram/Facebook APIs), including room code in shared message/link.",
    "Add per-round letter selection via a roulette/spinner using the Spanish alphabet (incl. Ñ) with no repeats across the match.",
    "STOP button should trigger local audio playback of a voice line when pressed (define whether TTS or a bundled audio asset).",
    "Support an in-game profile/registration step (e.g., username) and store it for visibility in admin/moderation tools.",
    "Automated jury/validation will be dictionary/heuristic-based (Venezuelan slang focus) and will set invalid entries to null; replaces player voting tribunal flow.",
    "Use a classic red octagonal STOP sign symbol as a UI image/icon where requested (not the custom STOP Venezolano logo)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Platform build attempts failed with generic error ('AI couldn't implement that'); may require breaking work into smaller steps.",
    "Roulette/spinner does not animate/spin at round start (should spin and stop on random non-repeating letter).",
    "Pressing STOP does not add points / scoreboard is not updating automatically.",
    "Final Ranking screen score also stays at 0/1000 (does not reflect computed points); user expects real-time updates during match and correct totals at end."
